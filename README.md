users to check,brainstorm and debug codes together. In a dynamic and competitive environment in the job market, coders often opt pair-programming and want to take mock
interviews of each other. The Live Coder addresses this need by leveraging collaborative
editor techniques and presenting it through a user-friendly interface.
The project methodology involves thorough requirements analysis, technology selection,
system design, implementation, and testing. Key features of Live Coder include real time collaborative code sharing in multiple programming C-like languages with integrated
video calling ,messaging capabilities ensuring seamless collaboration and enhanced productivity for developers. The development process adheres to best practices in software
